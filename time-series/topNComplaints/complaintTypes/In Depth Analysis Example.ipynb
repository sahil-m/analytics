    "# TODO add more details here\n",
    "A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed: it will have no predictable patterns in the long-term, in general. Time plots will show the series to be roughly horizontal (although some cyclic behaviour is possible) with constant variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "[3] details several methods to check for stationarity. They are reproduced towards the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain pre-processing steps one can use to induce stationarity in a non-stationary series. These include using a Box-Cox transform (typically with $\\lambda=0$ i.e log transform), differencing, or a combination of these steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformations such as logarithms can help to stabilize the variance of a time series. Differencing can help stabilize the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, and so eliminating trend and seasonality.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Box-Cox transforms\n",
    "This transform is used if there isn't constant variance in the data i.e the data varies (significantly) with time. Box-Cox transforms are detailed in [4]. The parameter to select is $\\lambda$. If $\\lambda=0$, then the transformation is equvalent to a log transform - which is probably the most common form. \n",
    "Note that the `forecast` module comes with this transform inherent in almost every modeling algorithm it has, so a explicit transformation is not needed, one only needs to supply a lambda parameter during modeling. Having said that, it is always a good idea to visualize the transformed data to ensure that the transformation has the intended effect."

Normally, the correct amount of differencing is the lowest order of differencing that yields a time series which fluctuates around a well-defined mean value and whose autocorrelation function (ACF) plot decays fairly rapidly to zero, either from above or below. If the series still exhibits a long-term trend, or otherwise lacks a tendency to return to its mean value, or if its autocorrelations are are positive out to a high number of lags (e.g., 10 or more), then it needs a higher order of differencing. \n",

A model with one order of differencing assumes that the original series has a constant average trend (e.g. a random walk or SES-type model, with or without growth). A model with two orders of total differencing assumes that the original series has a time-varying trend (e.g. a random trend or LES-type model).\n",

In particular, the partial autocorrelation at lag k is equal to the estimated AR(k) coefficient in an autoregressive model with k terms--i.e., a multiple regression model in which Y is regressed on LAG(Y,1), LAG(Y,2), etc., up to LAG(Y,k). Thus, by mere inspection of the PACF you can determine how many AR terms you need to use to explain the autocorrelation pattern in a time series: if the partial autocorrelation is significant at lag k and not significant at any higher order lags--i.e., if the PACF \"cuts off\" at lag k--then this suggests that you should try fitting an autoregressive model of order k \n",
